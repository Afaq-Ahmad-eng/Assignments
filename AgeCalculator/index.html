          <h1>Leap Year</h1>
          <p>
            A leap year adds one extra day, February 29th, to the calendar to
            keep it in sync with the Earth's journey around the Sun. This is
            needed because the Earth takes about 365.24219 days (or 365 days, 5
            hours, 48 minutes, and 45 seconds) to complete one full orbit around
            the Sun. However, our calendar normally counts only 365 days in a
            year. To adjust the extra 0.24219 days (5 hours, 48 minutes, and 45
            seconds), we add 6 hours each year. After four years, these extra
            hours add up to 24 hours, which equals one full day. So, every
            fourth year, we add February 29th as a leap day. However, this
            method actually adds about 44.6 extra minutes every four years. Over
            time, these extra minutes create an error. After about 25 leap
            years, the total extra time becomes roughly 18 hours, which causes
            the calendar to slowly fall out of sync. To fix this, we skip a leap
            year sometimes. But since skipping removes too much time, we still
            need to make up for about 6 hours. That’s why we add a leap year
            once every 400 years. In other words, any year divisible by 400 is
            also considered a leap year. This extra rule helps keep the Earth’s
            seasons and the calendar perfectly aligned with the Sun.
            <br />
            The rule for leap years has three parts: <br />
            1. Any year divisible by 4 is usually a leap year. <br />
            2. But if the year is also divisible by 100, it is not a leap year.
            <br />
            3. However, if the year is divisible by 400, then it is a leap year.
            <br />
            So, the year 2000 was a leap year, but 1900 was not. These rules are
            part of the Gregorian calendar system, which is used all over the
            world. This system is very accurate and keeps the calendar almost
            perfectly in line with the Earth’s orbit, with only a small error of
            about 26 seconds per year, which adds up to one day every 3,236
            years.

          <br />
          <strong>Solar Calendar</strong>
          <br />
          A solar calendar is based on the Earth's movement around the Sun. It
          measures a year as the time it takes for Earth to complete one full
          orbit, which is about 365.24 days. This type of calendar keeps the
          seasons (spring, summer, autumn, winter) aligned consistently with the
          same months each year. The most widely used solar calendar is the
          Gregorian calendar, followed by others like the Jalali and Ethiopian
          calendars. The main benefit of solar calendars is that they are ideal
          for agriculture, education, and everyday civil planning because they
          maintain a stable relationship with the seasons. However, one
          limitation is that they do not track the Moon’s phases, which makes
          them less useful for religious observances that depend on lunar
          cycles. Also, to correct the slight difference in time (about 0.24
          days), solar calendars need leap years to stay accurate over time.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Lunar Calendar</strong>
          <br />
          A lunar calendar follows the phases of the Moon. Each month begins
          with the sighting of a new moon and lasts approximately 29.5 days,
          making a lunar year about 354 days long—roughly 11 days shorter than a
          solar year. Because of this, lunar calendars do not stay aligned with
          the seasons, and the dates of festivals and months move earlier each
          year. The most well-known lunar calendar is the Islamic (Hijri)
          calendar, used for determining the dates of religious events such as
          Ramadan, Eid-ul-Fitr, and Hajj. The biggest advantage of a lunar
          calendar is that it perfectly matches the Moon’s natural cycle, making
          it highly suitable for religious rituals based on moon phases.
          However, its main limitation is that it does not match the seasons,
          which can create difficulties when timing events that depend on
          seasonal patterns.
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Lunisolar Calendar</strong>
          <br />
          A lunisolar calendar combines the features of both lunar and solar
          calendars. It uses lunar months (based on the Moon’s phases), but also
          adjusts itself to the solar year by adding an extra month, known as a
          leap month, every few years. This adjustment keeps the calendar in
          sync with both the Moon’s cycles and the seasons of the solar year.
          Lunisolar calendars are used in several traditional cultures,
          including the Hebrew, Chinese, and Hindu calendars. These calendars
          are especially useful for planning festivals that need to follow both
          lunar timing and seasonal placement. The main benefit of a lunisolar
          calendar is its balanced accuracy—it respects the Moon’s cycle while
          staying seasonally accurate. However, its limitation is complexity, as
          it requires careful calculations and astronomical observations to
          decide when to add a leap month and maintain alignment with the solar
          year.

          <h1>Age Calculation</h1>
          <p>
            To calculate age, we first check if the birth date (day) can be
            subtracted directly from the current date. If it can, we subtract it
            normally. However, if the current date is smaller than the birth
            date, we borrow a full month (28, 29, 30 or 31 days, depending on
            the month) and add it to the current date. Then, we subtract the
            birth date from the updated current date. Next, we check if the
            birth month can be subtracted from the current month. If it can, we
            subtract it directly. But if the birth month is greater than the
            current month, we borrow one full year (12 months) and add it to the
            current month. Then we subtract the birth month from the updated
            current month. After adjusting both the date and month, we subtract
            the birth year from the current year to get the final age in years.
            This method ensures that the result is always accurate, even if the
            birth date or birth month has not yet occurred in the current year.
